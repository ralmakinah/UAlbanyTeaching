## Course Description:

An introduction to the technical foundations of artificial intelligence
as well as its relevance to, and implications for modern society. The
course will cover the basics of artificial intelligence and machine
learning (AI/ML). This will include hands-on work. The importance of
data selection, handling, etc. will also be covered. In addition, as
AI/ML becomes more prevalent, it has tremendous implications in the
world. The course will introduce issues of fairness, bias,
explainability, etc., and how these and other issues must be addressed
in the design, deployment, and use of AI/ML systems.

## Prerequisites:

*None.*

## Required Readings:

The required text for this course is:

<img src="images/textbook.png" style="width:1.5in;height:2.35in"
alt="Artificial Intelligence Basics: A... by Taulli, Tom" />

- ***Taulli, Tom, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-technical
  Introduction.*** 2019. Apress. ISBN-13: 978-1-4842-5028-0.

In addition to the required text, there will be readings that will be
available to the students online or via Brightspace. When these readings
are assigned, the class will be told where they can be found. These will
cover the various topics in the course and will be drawn from the
literature in several fields (e.g. computer science, electrical and
computer engineering, psychology, informatics, law) to help inform us
about the multiple perspectives necessary to understand Artificial
Intelligence. This will also provide the underlying information to help
us learn to critically evaluate and navigate our own digital lives
securely in this rapidly changing world.

**TEAM-BASED LEARNING (TBL)**

This course uses Team-based Learning (TBL)[^1]. This section describes
how we will be using TBL in this class.

**AN ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL POINT:** The course is divided into learning
modules. You ***must*** do the readings for each module ***before*** the
unit’s start. This is because each unit starts with a Readiness
Assessment Test (RAT). Readings must be done before the RAT tests for
the module (dates given in the syllabus below). The RAT tests are based
solely upon the readings and not on lectures or other in-class
preparation beforehand.

**Teams**

This course will be using a Team-Based-Learning (TBL) format. This
instructional method aims to help develop your learning skills and will
be done in a way that will hold teams accountable for using course
content to make decisions that will be reported publicly and subject to
cross-team discussion/critique. You will be assigned to a team with
approximately 5 members. 


**Phase 1 – Preparation:** You will complete **specified readings** to
begin each module.

**Phase 2 – Readiness Assurance Test:** At the first class meeting of
each module, you will be given a **Readiness Assurance Test (RAT) (Quizzes on BrightSpace).** The
RAT test (10 multiple-choice questions) measures your comprehension of
the assigned readings and helps you learn the material needed to begin
problem-solving in phase 3. The purpose of Phase 2 is to ensure that you
and your teammates have sufficient foundational knowledge to begin
learning how to apply and use the course concepts in Phase 3. **RATs are
closed-book and based on the assigned readings.**

**Phase 3 - In-Class Activities:** You and your team use the
foundational knowledge acquired in the first two phases to make
decisions that will be reported publicly and subject to cross-team
discussion/critique. We will use a variety of methods to have you report
your team’s decision at the end of each activity. The presentation of
your team responses is critical to the team grade. You should expect
each team member to present individually and for the entire team to
present with smooth transitions.

**Phase 4 – Lab Sessions:** Throughout the semester, there will be a total 
of five laboratory sessions. These labs are designed to be completed 
collaboratively in teams. Students are required to form teams consisting of
two members. Each team must complete the assigned lab during the designated 
time within the lecture session period. Following the lab session, each team
member is responsible for preparing a detailed lab report, documenting the 
steps, processes, findings, and any other relevant information. The lab report 
template will be provided by the course teaching assistant. Attendance is mandatory 
for all lab sessions, as each lab contributes to a portion of the final grade. 
Please note that no makeup sessions will be offered unless a valid official excuse, 
such as a medical certificate, is provided.

The above formula is the definitive grading scheme. Any “Total,”
“Weighted Total,” etc. given by Brightspace does not reflect the actual
grading scheme and should be ignored.

Grades are assigned based upon the percentage of points achieved by the
student in the course, as weighted per the above table. The overall
course **will not** be curved, although the professor retains the right
curve individual assignments if the grade distribution is extreme enough
to unfairly weight the overall course against the students.

This course is A-E graded and the grades are determined based on graded
assignments. Your final grade will be based on a scale of 100 points:

| **A**  | **A-** | **B+** | **B** | **B-** | **C+** | **C** | **C-** | **D+** | **D** | **D-** | **E** |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|--------|--------|-------|--------|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| 100-94 | 93-89  | 88-85  | 84-82 | 81-79  | 78-76  | 75-73 | 72-70  | 69-67  | 66-64 | 63-60  | 59-0  |

## CEHC Showcase

**CEHC Showcase** is designed as an opportunity for students within the
information, informatics, game design and development, emergency
management, homeland security and cybersecurity fields to highlight and
present interesting projects, research, and concepts they are learning
within their courses. It also provides students with an opportunity to
showcase their findings to others and develop highly desired
presentation and people skills. The CEHC Showcase is in Fall 2024
semester will be held on ***December 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2024***. All students in CINF 135 will be
presenting at this event and should reserve that time in their schedule.
If your schedule does not permit you to attend, you will have an
alternative assignment. ***Note:*** I grade easier for Showcase
presentations than for the alternative assignment so you should
seriously consider your schedule limitations! You are required to prepare a poster for presentation, which will be printed at no cost by the university. Please monitor announcements on Brightspace carefully to ensure you meet the printing deadline. The template will be provided to you over BrightSpace.


## Policies:

**Attendance Policy:** This is an in-person course, and therefore there
are specified class sessions where attendance will be taken. Course
progression will be measured by completion of the required assignments
and exams, and there are grade given for participation or attendance.

**Missed Exams and Assignments:** Students missing an examination or
exercise due to illness or personal/family emergencies will be excused
**provided** that you notify the professor via email on the day of the
absence or earlier that the absence meets university policies on excused
absences ([see the
link](https://www.albany.edu/undergraduate_bulletin/regulations.html)),
and that **required documentation** is submitted to the professor at the
next class session. Any assignments missed due to a documented and
approved absence will need to be made up within one week of the absence,
and it is the student’s responsibility to coordinate with the professor
to make up the assignment within that time period.

**Absence due to religious observance:** New York State Education Law
(Section 224-a) - Campuses are required to excuse, without penalty,
individual students absent because of religious beliefs, and to provide
equivalent opportunities for make-up examinations, study, or work
requirements missed because of such absences. You will be required to
notify the professor **at least three days prior** to the religious
observance that you will not be able to complete the assignment, and
then an alternative date or accommodation will be made.

**Disability Policy:** Reasonable accommodations will be provided for
students with documented physical, sensory, systemic, medical,
cognitive, learning and mental health (psychiatric) disabilities. If you
believe you have a disability requiring accommodation in this class,
please notify [Disability Access and Inclusion Student
Services](mailto:Disability%20Access%20and%20Inclusion%20Student%20Services)
(518- 442-5501; daiss@albany.edu). Upon verification and after the
registration process is complete, the DAISS will provide you with a
letter that informs the course instructor that you are a student with a
disability registered with the DAISS and list the recommended reasonable
accommodations. You can review the [Equity and Compliance
website](https://www.albany.edu/equity-compliance) as well for
additional information.

**Extra Credit: Extra credit can be earned in a number of ways. All require consultation with the instructor before they are commenced. All extra-credit opportunities are capped at no more than 3 points (3%) of your overall grade.**

- *Community:* CEHC sponsors several events throughout the semester. Any
  student who attends one or more of those events may receive extra
  credit. Details about specific qualifying events will be made
  available in advance.

- Other extra credit opportunities may be available. Details to follow.

**Withdrawal from the Course:** The drop date for the Fall 2024
semester is Monday, September 9th for undergraduate students. That is
the last date you can drop a course and not receive a 'W'. It is your
responsibility to take action by this date if you wish to drop the
course. In particular, grades of "incomplete" will not be awarded to
students because they missed the drop deadline.

**Incomplete Grade Policy (amended effective Fall 2020 and will apply to
all undergraduate Incompletes issued Fall 2020 and thereafter):**

I: Incomplete. A grade of I is a temporary grade assigned at the
discretion of the instructor when a student has been unable to complete
a class for reasons which are considered to be extenuating and beyond
the student's control. These reasons must be documented at the time of
the request. Incomplete grades do not count toward graduation.

Undergraduate students taking graduate level classes will be subject to
the Graduate Incomplete Policy for the graduate class.

Incomplete grades should ONLY be assigned:

1.  When a student makes a direct request to the instructor;

2.  The student's work to date is passing;

3.  An illness or other extenuating circumstance prevents completion of
    required work by the due date;

4.  Required work may reasonably be completed in an agreed-upon period
    (not to exceed the maximum allowable time for the completion of work
    as stated in the Timeline for Incomplete Grades), and does not
    require the student to retake any portion of the class.

If all of the above four criteria are not met, the student should be
graded according to the work completed for the class, even if this means
recording a failing grade.

Students and instructors should be mindful that making up work can be
extremely difficult given the workload of a new semester.

Incomplete grades should NOT be assigned:

- To students who do not make a direct request to the instructor

- As a substitute for a failing grade

- Where the student's performance to date clearly indicates an inability
  to complete the class as defined in the original syllabus

- If the student did not attend or stopped attending

- As a means of allowing a student to raise their grade by completing
  additional work not assigned to other students

- If re-enrollment is required for successful completion of the class

**Timeline for Incomplete Grades**

The maximum allowable time for the completion of work related to an
Incomplete is:

- Fall and Winter: convert to failing grades in April of the following
  Spring semester – dates and deadlines to be communicated by the
  Registrar’s office

- Spring and Summer: convert to failing grades in November of the
  following Fall semester – dates and deadlines to be communicated by
  the Registrar’s office

Dates and deadlines will be listed on the Academic Calendar and
communicated by the Registrar’s Office.

Instructors may require that work be completed in advance of the
deadline.

Questions about incomplete grades should be addressed to the instructor.
If an incomplete grade is agreed upon, the instructor is responsible for
entering the incomplete grade in the grade roster during final grading,
as well as changing the grade to a final grade by the incomplete grade
deadline. See Guidelines for Instructors for more information on
entering and changing grades. If an instructor is no longer available,
the chair of the department or dean of the school/college, in which the
class was offered, is authorized to supervise completion of the work and
to submit the appropriate grade change request.

Any grade of I existing after the stated deadline shall be automatically
changed to E or U according to whether or not the student is enrolled
for A–E or S/U grading. Except for extenuating circumstances approved by
the Office of the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education, these
converted grades may not be later changed.

(NOTE: Students receiving financial assistance through state awards
should refer to Academic Criteria for State Awards in the expenses and
financial aid section of this bulletin before requesting grades of I.)

*Important:* Incompletes will not be given to students who have not
fulfilled their classwork obligations, and who, at the end of the
semester, are looking to avoid failing the course. This is asking for
special treatment.

**Academic Integrity: It is every student’s responsibility to become familiar with the standards of academic integrity at the University. Claims of ignorance, of unintentional error, or of academic or personal pressures are not sufficient reasons for violations of academic integrity. See <http://www.albany.edu/undergraduate_bulletin/regulations.html>**

Coursework and examinations are considered individual exercises. Copying
the work of others is a violation of university rules on academic
integrity.  Individual coursework is also key to your being prepared and
performing well on tests and exams. Forming study groups and discussing
assignments and techniques in general terms is encouraged, but the final
work must be your own work. **For example, two or more people may not
create an assignment together and submit it for credit. Credit will not
be given for identical final project reports with different color
palettes used on graphs submitted by two or more people.** If you have
specific questions about this or any other policy, please ask.

The following is a list of the types of behaviors that are defined as
examples of academic dishonesty and are therefore unacceptable. Attempts
to commit such acts also fall under the term academic dishonesty and are
subject to penalty. No set of guidelines can, of course, define all
possible types or degrees of academic dishonesty; thus, the following
descriptions should be understood as examples of infractions rather than
an exhaustive list.

- Plagiarism

- Allowing other students to see or copy your assignments or exams

- Examining or copying another student’s assignments or exams

- Lying to the professor about issues of academic integrity

- Submitting the same work for multiple assignments/classes without
  prior consent from the instructor(s)

- Getting answers or help from people, or other sources (*e.g.* research
  papers, web sites) without acknowledging them.

- Forgery

- Sabotage

- Unauthorized Collaboration (just check first!)

- Falsification

- Bribery

- Theft, Damage, or Misuse of Library or Computer Resources

*Any* incident of academic dishonesty in this course, no matter how
"minor" will result in

- No credit for the affected assignment.

- A written report will be sent to the appropriate University
  authorities (*e.g.* the Dean of Undergraduate Studies)

- One of -

  - A final mark reduction by *at* *least* one-half letter grade (*e.g.*
    B → B-, C- → D+),

  - A Failing mark (E) in the course, and referral of the matter to the
    University Judicial System for disposition.

**Time Management: For every credit hour that a course meets, students should expect to work 3 additional hours outside of class every week (3 x 3= 9). For a three-credit course, you should expect to work 9 hours outside of class every week. Manage your time effectively to complete readings, assignments, and projects.**

**Instructor Availability**: The instructor will be available for
student consultation during office hours, by appointment, and online in
Brightspace. Students are expected to check Brightspace messages
(internal) at least once every day to see whether the instructor is
trying to reach them. Students should not assume that instructor is
online 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to answer your questions
immediately (even though the instructor will try to do so as much as
possible).

**Courtesy** In class (online) discussions the instructor and students
are expected to demonstrate professional behavior. This means
cooperating and interacting in a courteous, supportive, and tactful
manner based on mutual respect for each other's ideas.

**Students and professor should be professional at all time. Faculty
should be addressed as Prof. XXX or Dr. XXX. Emails should be addressed
“Dear…” and end with a “Thank you.” *Disrespect in any form in any CEHC
class will not be tolerated.***

**Respect for Diversity:** It is my intent that students from all
diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, that
students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that
the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource,
strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and
activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality,
disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, and culture.
Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways
to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for
other students or student groups. In addition, if any of our class
meetings conflict with your religious events, please let me know so that
we can make arrangements for you.[^3]
